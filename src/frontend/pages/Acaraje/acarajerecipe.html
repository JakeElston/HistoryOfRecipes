        <strong>Serves:</strong> 20<br>
        <strong>Time:</strong> 30 minutes
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
        2 cups black-eyed or field peas<br>
        1 tsp Kosher salt<br>
        ½ tsp black pepper<br>
        1 medium onion, chopped<br>
        20 pieces dried shrimp<br>
        Vegetable oil (or dendê oil, or a 50/50 mix) for deep-frying
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Directions:</strong><br>
        1. Soak the peas overnight in water. Rub them at the end of the soaking period to remove their skins. Skim off floating skins and discard. You may need to drain, re-cover with water, and rub again.<br>
        2. Soak the shrimp for 30 minutes, then drain.<br>
        3. Puree the beans, shrimp, and chopped onion in a food processor.<br>
        4. Add salt and pepper, then whip some air into the mixture with a spoon.<br>
        5. Form the mixture into 20 small balls, or press a dried shrimp partly into the center of each ball so it remains visible.<br>
        6. Heat oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Fry the balls in small batches for about 3 minutes per side, until golden brown all over.<br>
        7. Drain the oil and keep the fritters warm. Serve hot as a first course or snack.
